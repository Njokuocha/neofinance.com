This is indeed the second website I am making professiomal though I once made a banking website but it wasn't as good as this because that was during my frontend project as a beginner. I made this project to refresh my brain on frontend programming, HTML and CSS precisely because I am about to enroll into JAVASCRIPT full course. I believe in myself, looking at the projects of other people can make you think that you know nothing but inside you there's a lot of potentials. This is one of my amazing projects though it's just a homepage interface completed.
Here's my motto: "Face your fears and get rid of it".
Always have in mind that there are people who are more better than you...
Never study to showcase what you know but study to have it installed in your memory.
## I am gonna miss you GITHUB after I upload this but when next I would visit I pray to come along with an amazing/sophisticating project and I know you would always welcome me. ##
